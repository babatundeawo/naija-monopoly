## About

Naija Monopoly (Wealth Wahala Edition) takes the classic property-trading game to Nigeria. You buy streets from Yaba to Banana Island, ride the Lagos and Kano railways, and pay NEPA when the light is on. It is for two to four players on one device, with any seat playable by a person or the computer. It is a fan-made, unofficial parody and is not affiliated with Hasbro.

## Features

- The full official rule set: ₦1,500 starting cash, ₦200 for passing GO, doubles, jail, taxes and bankruptcy
- Auctions when a player declines to buy, open to every player
- Houses and hotels with even building and a limited bank supply of 32 houses and 12 hotels
- Mortgages (unmortgage at the mortgage value plus 10%) and player-to-player trades of property and cash
- Computer opponents that roll, buy, bid and answer trade offers
- Nigerian flavour throughout: Aza Chance and Ileya Chest cards, Kirikiri Prison, NEPA and NITEL, and tokens such as the Danfo Bus, Okada and Jollof Pot
- Synthesised sound effects you can mute, and a camera that follows the active player or shows the whole board
- Light and dark themes, keyboard-friendly controls and a layout that works from phones to wide screens
- Also packaged as a Windows desktop app, built by the repository's *Build Windows EXE* workflow

## How to use it

1. Open the [live site](https://babatundeawo.github.io/naija-monopoly/).
2. Choose two to four players. Give each a name and a token, and decide whether a person or the computer plays that seat.
3. Select **Start game**, then **Roll dice** on your turn. Landing on a property lets you buy it or send it to auction.
4. Select any property tile to read its deed. Use the left panel to build, and **Propose trade** to deal with another player.
5. The last player who is not bankrupt wins. Open **Rules** at any time for a reminder.
